<a href="http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/" target="_blank">The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns</a> (핵심 파이썬)

Welcome, fellow Pythoneer! This is a small book of Python anti-patterns and worst practices. Learning about these anti-patterns will help you to avoid them in your own code and make you a better programmer (hopefully). Each pattern comes with a small description, examples and possible solutions.

NBA real time scores already have an API but I thought I would make one using Kimono’s really easy scraping chrome extension anyway. (Note: I don’t work for them, they just have a cool product). First we have to grab the values we think are important on the ESPN NBA home page. That would be the home team name, away team name, scores, and the score time. Full github code is here.

A little over a year ago we started archiving all of the logs generated by PyPI and today we’ll take a look at these logs to see how various things have changed in that time. This data comes from parsing the user agents of the tools downloading files from PyPI and because of that it’s reliability is dependent on the reliability of that data.

Pytest is an awesome testing package for Python. It makes writing test really easy and its reporting capabilities for test failures are extremely helpful.However, it currently (as of version 2.7) doesn’t help you very much with testing (asyncio) coroutines. So a naïve approach for testing coroutines would be ...
