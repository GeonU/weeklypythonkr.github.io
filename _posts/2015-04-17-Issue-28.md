Async frameworks like Tornado scramble our usual unittest strategies: how can you validate the outcome when you do not know when to expect it? Here's my PyCon 2015 talk about Tornado's testing module. You can also read my article on the topic or see a screencast which I closed-captioned. 


<a href="https://youtu.be/G-uKNd5TSBw" target="_blank">Guido van Rossum's keynote at PyCon 2015</a> (pycon)

Watching these PyCon videos has been an immense learning for me and I am glad that I could spare time to go through them. The event is divided in 2 parts: Tutorials (Workshops) or talks. Workshops aim to provide 3 hour hands on sessions where the instructor also acts as a facilitator. In this article, I have compiled a list of workshop videos you should watch from PyCon 2015.

Rust is a new systems programming language from Mozilla that combines strong compile-time correctness guarantees with fast performance... and it plays nice with ctypes! Come learn how you can call Rust functions from Python code and finally say goodbye to hacking C!

You know Python 3 is an improvement over Python 2 and you want to use it. Unfortunately you have legacy Python 2 source code that needs to stay compatible. But don't fret! This talk will show you that you can make your code be Python 2/3 source-compatible using various tools to pick up the nitty-gritty work and help modernize your Python code to newer Python 2 practices. 


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkwZ1jG3XgA" target="_blank">James Bennett - Django in Depth - PyCon 2015 - YouTube</a> (pycon) 

This is a tutorial that goes beyond most tutorials; it's meant for developers who already know a bit about Django and want to really understand the inner guts of the framework. This tutorial will *not* involve writing code or apps; rather, it'll be a deep tour of the workings and APIs of Django itself, across all the bundled components and at all levels of the stack.

Have you heard about internationalization (i18n) and wondered what it meant? Perhaps your project already has i18n of its strings but you have a nagging feeling you could be doing it better. This talk will walk through the basics of i18n’ing a Django project (but the principles apply to any project!), and how to make the process of localization (l10n) go more smoothly. 


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGwNQfjLTp0" target="_blank">I was at PyCon, too! My talk was about hash functions, bloom filters, and security!</a> (pycon)

Our trusty friend, the hash function, is as crucial to programming as linked lists or recursion, but it doesn't always get the press that it deserves. We're going to talk about hash functions, some data structures involving hash functions, the stately bloom filter, and the security implications of password hashing.

The behavior of names and values in Python can be confusing. Like many parts of Python, it has an underlying simplicity that can be hard to discern, especially if you are used to other programming languages. Here I'll explain how it all works, and present some facts and myths along the way. Call-by-reference? Call-by-value? The answer will be clear!

All Python programmers use the import statement, but do you really know how it works and what it allows? This tutorial aims to take a deep dive into every diabolical issue related to modules, packages, and imports. When we're done, you'll finally be ready to unleash your million line micro framework on the world!
